Mice are a disease. Clicking around your editor like a caveman dragging a cursor through molasses is no way to live.
You want to stop fumbling around like a toddler in a GUI ball pit? Cool. You're in the right place.
This config is built around staying on the keyboard as much as possible: quick file browsing, fuzzy search, live grep, diagnostics, working LSPs, and terminals that don’t get in your way. Everything’s meant to be fast, simple, and distraction-free.
I’ve spent a lot of time tweaking it to feel intuitive and clean, so figured I'd share it here in case it helps someone else find their flow too.
